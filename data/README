Data in the `scraped` directory belongs to their respectful owners. No copyright infringement intended. 

I first wrote quick-and-hacky scrapers for a variety of color name sources and put the results in the `scraped` folder. I then took the results from that,
and paid Amazon Mechanical Turk to have 5 different people come up with their own color given the color name, that way I can see how close the actual color is
to everyone's guesses as well as determine a 'weighting' for each example during training.

Scripts written in this directory were written as fast as possible. Code quality was not important here.
